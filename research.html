        <p>My research focuses on galaxy formation and evolution especially on galaxy quenching. I am trying to understand why a galaxy stops forming new stars.</p>
           <h3 style="color:blue;font-size:30px"> Dynamical hotness, star formation quenching and growth of supermassive black holes</h3>
           <p>With Mappping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) survey, we study galaxies in spatially resovled perspective.  A stellar system is dynamically hot when its kinetic energy is dominated by random motion represented by the stellar mass-depedent velocity dispersion <span class="math">$\sigma_{\rm hot}(M_*)$</span>. Both inner and outer velocity dispersion (<span class="math">$\sigma_{\rm in}$</span> and <span class="math">$\sigma_{\rm out}$</span>) of a galaxy are taken to characterize its dynamical status and study its connection with star-formation quenching and the growth of supermassive black hole (SMBH). We classify galaxies into fully quenched galaxies (FQGs), partially quenched galaxies (PQGs), and fully star-forming galaxies (FSGs), and identify central quenched cores (QCCs), which reside in the center of PQGs and have the same quenching property as FQGs. <strong> <em>We propose the two-<span class="math">$\sigma$</span> (<span class="math">$\sigma_{\rm in}/\sigma_{\rm hot}-\sigma_{\rm out}/\sigma_{\rm hot}$</span>) diagram.</em> </strong>  The galaxy distribution on two-<span class="math">$\sigma$</span> diagram is L-shape, consisting of a horizontal sequence (<span class="math">$\sigma_{\rm out}/\sigma_{\rm hot}$</span> ∼ 0, with cold outskirt) and a vertical sequence (<span class="math">$\sigma_{\rm in}/\sigma_{\rm hot}$</span> ∼ 1, with hot center). FQGs and QCCs are located at the top of the vertical sequence, <span class="math">$\sigma_{\rm out}/\sigma_{\rm hot}$</span> ~1, and are thus dynamically hot over their entire bodies. PQGs reside along the vertical sequence, so they have hot center but cold outskirt. FSGs are diverse and can be found in both sequences. Galaxy structural properties, star formation and AGN activities make a transition along the horizontal sequence at <span class="math">$\sigma_{\rm in}/\sigma_{\rm hot}$</span> ∼ 0.5, and along the vertical sequence at <span class="math">$\sigma_{\rm out}/\sigma_{\rm hot}$</span> ∼ 0.5. The fractions of optical AGNs and barred galaxies start to increase rapidly in the first transition and decline rapidly in the second; radio galaxies are located at the top of the vertical sequence. <strong><em>Our results demonstrate that star formation quenching and the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBH) are effective only in dynamically hot systems </em></strong>. A simple model along this line can reproduce the observed scaling relations of the SMBH mass with galaxy mass and velocity dispersion. We discuss how secular processes and strong interactions can make a system dynamically hot, and lead to the growth of its SMBH and the quenching of its star formation.

        <h3 style="color:blue;font-size:30px">Differences in color profiles between satellite and central galaxies: evidence for outside-in quenching</h3>
        <p> We analyzed photometric images (g, r, and i bands) of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (DR7). These galaxies were categorized into star-forming galaxies (SFGs), transition galaxies (TGs), and quiescent galaxies (QGs). Using a substantial dataset, we compared the differences in color profiles (specifically, g-r color) between satellite galaxies and their corresponding central galaxies with similar stellar mass and redshift. Our findings reveal that, on average, satellite galaxies are redder across all radii compared to central galaxies. <strong><em>The color difference increases with radius, suggesting that environmental effects are more pronounced in the outskirts of galaxies,</strong></em> where the gravitational potential is weaker. This observation supports an 'outside-in' quenching mode for environmental processes. Notably, we observed the most significant color differences in transition galaxies (TGs) in comparison to SFGs and QGs. This reaffirms that TGs represent a transitional phase toward quenching. Additionally, the color differences become more pronounced at smaller halo-centric distances and with larger halo mass, where environment is denser. Moreover, we found that the difference in mass surface density profiles between satellite and central galaxies is negligible. This implies that environmental processes predominantly affect gas, as opposed to stars, favoring the concept of ram pressure stripping over tidal stripping. This is the <a href="pdf/paper_draft_color.pdf">paper draft</a>. Main figures are all included.</p>

        <h3 style="color:blue;font-size:30px">Dynamics and quenching of satellite galaxies</h3>
        <p>Based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02910"> Hong et al. 2023</a>, we analyze the dynamics and quenching properites of satellite galaxies. The quenching mode in satellite galaxies is quite different from what we observed in central galaxies. There are many interseting results. I am writing this paper. Stay tuned!</p>

        <h3 style="color:blue;font-size:30px">Duty cycle of radio galaxies</h3>
        <p> How do massive quenched galaxies sustain quenching status? Radio galaxies are competitive candidates! The radio jets emitted by these galaxies can heat the gas in dark matter halos, preventing it from cooling and forming new stars. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02910"> Hong et al. 2023</a> has found that radio galaxies are dynamically hot from inner to outer. Beyond their dynamical status, what other properties do radio galaxies share? We use machine learning method to classify galaxies into possible radio galaxies and non-radio galaxies. To explore this question, we have employed a machine learning method to classify galaxies into potential radio galaxies and non-radio galaxies. I am the co-first author in collaboration with a computer science lab and an undergraduate student at USTC. We are currently writing this paper. Stay tuned!</p>
